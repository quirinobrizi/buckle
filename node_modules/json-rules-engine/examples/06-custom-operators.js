/*
 * This example demonstrates using custom operators.
 *
 * A custom operator is created for detecting whether the word starts with a particular letter,
 * and a 'word' fact is defined for providing the test string
 *
 * In this example, Facts are passed to run() as constants known at runtime.  For a more
 * complex example demonstrating asynchronously computed facts, see the fact-dependency example.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node ./examples/06-custom-operators.js
 *
 * For detailed output:
